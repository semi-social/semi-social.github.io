# Welcome!

The goal of semi.social is to provide services to safely communicate online - with high standards of security and privacy - provided to you by me, [Sindastra](https://sindastra.github.io/).

Currently I provide a semi-public Matrix server. Message content is protected by enforced end-to-end encryption and meta-data is protected by full-disk encryption that needs to be manually unlocked with a long, unique, random key. Matrix transport is secured by TLS 1.2-1.3 (both client and federation) and the server is hosted in Germany. Security updates are installed automatically, including live kernel updates ("Livepatching").

If you have questions about the security or think I forgot to mention something, please contact me by email (see below).

I use hardware security keys and 2FA wherever possible, to prevent unauthorized access to systems and control panels.

If you find a security issue or weakness, please contact me by email using PGP (and don't break things or disrupt services, thanks).

# Contact

You can contact me by email with PGP using the following public key:

[Click here to download the ASCII-armored public key](0x82546B27A545ED1E-pub.asc) or alternatively [click here to view in browser](PGP.md)

The fingerprint is ```7D97 CB67 6534 7DA5 C7E1 8FD7 8254 6B27 A545 ED1E```

I did not provide the email address in cleartext on this site because of bots that scrape for email addresses and then start to spam you. You can get the email address from the public key, though. It also has a nice side effect that it will filter people that don't use PGP. ;)

PS Marketing emails will be ignored.
